# NQueens Visualization Blender Project

## Description
**nqueens.blend** visualizes various algorithms for solving the N-Queens problem. Each scene in the project showcases a different algorithm, namely the 4-Queens, 5-Queens, 6-Queens, and 8-Queens algorithms.

The project features a chessboard environment where the N-Queens problem is solved visually through code-generated animations. The animations demonstrate how the queens are placed on the board without conflicting with each other according to the rules of chess.

## Usage
To use this project, simply download the ```nqueens.blend``` file and open it in Blender. You can then navigate through the scenes and play(```Shift Spacebar``` *(2.8+)* or  ```Alt A``` *(2.79)* ) to visualize the different algorithms in action.

No running of additional code is needed as the animations are already baked into the scenes. However, the code used to generate the animations is included within the project in case you wish to review or modify it.

Please note that the folder includes all necessary textures and assets. However, it does not use relative paths.Depending on your Blender settings, you may need to manually adjust some paths.

## Instructions
1. Download the **nqueens.blend** file.
2. Open Blender.
3. Open the **nqueens.blend** file within Blender.
4. Navigate through the scenes to view the different N-Queens algorithms.

## Additional Notes
- This project is intended for educational purposes to visually demonstrate various N-Queens algorithms.
- Feel free to explore and modify the project as needed. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

Enjoy visualizing N-Queens algorithms!
